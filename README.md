# LOG 
- 2021-03-20_21-44-23_  
  - updated readmes in flexpart_management (fm)
  - copying code from fm
  - [x] create repository
  - [x] download to puhti
  - [ ] maybe data shoud contain center lat lon? 
- 2021-03-21_10-59-55_
  - output from
    z010_get_flx_log_pol_coords_taito.py
    is giving a flat line for lat lon :(  
    see:  flexpart_alto/nbs/nb_run_2021-03-14_20-15-10_LONG/z020_check_z010_output.ipynb
  - [x] check why is happening
    - the error is in line 658 from flx_array.py
    - I was doing lat instead of lon conversion
  - managed to have a functioning script for
  --z030_get_flx_log_pol_coords_puhti.py--
  for converting from rect to logpolar
  - [x] next I will write a script to have it run in pareallel in the super computer:
    - [x] write the script with name: 
    - [x] create a list to be executed at puhti 
    - this time we will try to use the slurm array functionality
    - [x] delete al test logpol files from puhti 
- 2021-03-22_09-36-42_
  - finish the run
    - d01 runned ok. but d02 run out of memory for some files
